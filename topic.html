  <p>"It was the memorable day" of my life because I was able to see the happiness in my mother’s eyes. I could not believe my ears as I never dreamed of such achievements. I have two special guys who I want to give everything to, and make their b-days something they can remember, and make them feel special even to the last moment of the day. However, the entire ordeal was well worth it. My oldest brother was responsible of taking care of me and so was my other brother, but my oldest brother was more of a father figure to me. Christmas produces many of my favorite, cherished memories. It was an awesome experience to watch my body and abdomen take on different shapes and sizes as my child grew inside me. I will marvel at God’s seemingly simple gifts: the morning dew, the sun, the clouds, the trees, the flowers, the birds. All of the teaching staff was impressed after reading it. The birth of a child is a blessed moment in anyone's life. There are some memorable days and they remain evergreen in my heart. I had spent so much time working out every detail, and I thought I had it perfect.</p>
